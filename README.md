# Flutter nested navigation
In this project, I use [Getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get), [Getx_pattern](https://github.com/kauemurakami/getx_pattern) for the structure of the project.
This example teaches you how to:
- Setup getx in main.dart
- Initializes structure of getx pattern
- Create a bottom navigation bar
- Nested navigation along with the bottom navigation bar
